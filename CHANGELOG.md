# Changelog

## Version 0.1.0

- Web server application application allows users to create their own vocabulary sheets.
- A user can create flash-card question and answer pairs. They can also create inflection tables, which might contain, for example, all the conjugations of the infinitive verb "to go".
- A user can test themeselves on a vocabulary sheet, while the application uses spaced repetition to ensure the user only receives the words most needing attention.
